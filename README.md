# IMCIS-artifact
IMCIS is a statistical model checker for the analysis of interval Markov chains. Instead of having transitions with fixed probability (as in Markov Chains), IMCs allow each transition to have an interval of probability, which makes it more flexible in modelling systems and a suitable model for probabilistic learning. IMCIS is written in Java, supports a subset of BLTL properties (see documentation) and incorporates a cross-entropy algorithm to determine an importance sampling distribution. We have built a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate its use and tested our platform on multiple models.
